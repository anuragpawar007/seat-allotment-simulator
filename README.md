# Seat Allotment Simulator 🎓

This is a simple web-based simulator inspired by the JoSAA counseling process.  
It allows users to select their preferred engineering branches and randomly allocates one based on predefined probabilities — simulating how a real seat allocation system might behave.

## 🎲 Allotment Logic

Based on your order of preferences, the simulator randomly assigns you a branch with the following weighted chances:

- 1st Preference: 50%
- 2nd: 25%
- 3rd: 15%
- 4th: 6%
- 5th: 2%
- 6th: 1%
- 7th: 1%
